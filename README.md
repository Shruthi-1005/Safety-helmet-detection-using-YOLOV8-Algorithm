# Safety-helmet-detection-using-YOLOV8-Algorithm

This project uses **YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once)** to detect whether a person is wearing a **safety helmet** or not.  
It can be used in construction sites, industries, factories, and safety monitoring systems to prevent workplace accidents.

## 🚀 Features
- Real-time helmet detection  
- Detects both **helmet** and **no-helmet**  
- Works on images, videos, and webcam  
- High accuracy using YOLOv8  
- Fast inference speed  
- Easy to train on custom dataset
 
## 🧰 Tech Stack
- Python  
- YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)  
- OpenCV  
- NumPy  
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab  / VS Code

## Steps to be followed
Open MAJOR on desktop 
<br>Click on file folder vt....
<br>Again click on same folder
<br>Click on code
<br>Copy the path 
<br>Open anaconda

<br>Now type python app.py  enter 
<br>Now after the process a link is visible copy it and paste on any browser 
<br>A page appears to start here 
<br>Click on it 
<br>Click on upload image or video 
<br>Now it goes to folders 
<br>Got to major file again select same files
